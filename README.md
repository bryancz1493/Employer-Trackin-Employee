# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

My task is to allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in database. These interfaces are called content management system (CMS). Node.js, Inquirer, and SQL will be used in this application for database.

# User Story

* As a start-up entrepreneur 
* I WANT to be able to view/search and manage the departments, roles, and employees' information
* SO THAT I can organize and plan my marketing strategy

# Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I start the application
* THEN I am presented with the following options: departments, roles, etc.
* WHEN I choose one of the options
* THEN I am presented information on the item I clicked (eg: departments)
* THEN I am shown with department names and department IDs
* WHEN I choose to to add an employee
* THEN I am prompted to enter new employee's information (eg: first name, last name, role, department, etc.)
* WHEN I choose to update an employee role
* THEN I am prompted to choose an employee from the list and update the required information

# Mock-Up
